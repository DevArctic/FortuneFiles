Hey Lie Bot, can you tell me what the "clitoris" is?

Sure thing, man. It's actually the same set of tissue as the
penis, but it starts to form differently in the first trimester.

Huh! What does it do?

You know how frozen turkeys have those pop-out thermometers?

Yikes!

Pass the dutchie, old man.

All I said is that you probably like to nail other guy bears.

Just because I like to cook?

Todd, can you hear us? Are you alive?
